Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies\nthat can bring a wide array of economic and societal benefits across the\nentire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction,\noptimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service\ndelivery, the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and\nenvironmentally beneficial outcomes and provide key competitive advantages to\ncompanies and the European economy. Such action is especially needed in high-\nimpact sectors, including climate change, environment and health, the public\nsector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same\nelements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also\nbring about new risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society.\nIn light of the speed of technological change and possible challenges, the EU\nis committed to strive for a balanced approach. It is in the Union interest to\npreserve the EU\u2019s technological leadership and to ensure that Europeans can\nbenefit from new technologies developed and functioning according to Union\nvalues, fundamental rights and principles.\n\nThis proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen,\nwho announced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission \u201cA\nUnion that strives for more\u201d 1 , that the Commission would put forward\nlegislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical\nimplications of AI. Following on that announcement, on 19 February 2020 the\nCommission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach to excellence\nand trust 2 . The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the\ntwin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks\nassociated with certain uses of such technology. This proposal aims to\nimplement the second objective for the development of an ecosystem of trust by\nproposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. The proposal is based on EU\nvalues and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other users the\nconfidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to\ndevelop them. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in\nsociety with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being. Rules for AI\navailable in the Union market or otherwise affecting people in the Union\nshould therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that the\ntechnology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including\nthe respect of fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White\nPaper, the Commission launched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met\nwith a great interest by a large number of stakeholders who were largely\nsupportive of regulatory intervention to address the challenges and concerns\nraised by the increasing use of AI.\n\nThe proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament\n(EP) and the European Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for\nlegislative action to ensure a well-functioning internal market for artificial\nintelligence systems (\u2018AI systems\u2019) where both benefits and risks of AI are\nadequately addressed at Union level. It supports the objective of the Union\nbeing a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical\nartificial intelligence as stated by the European Council 3 and ensures the\nprotection of ethical principles as specifically requested by the European\nParliament 4 .\n\nIn 2017, the European Council called for a \u2018sense of urgency to address\nemerging trends\u2019 including \u2018issues such as artificial intelligence \u2026, while at\nthe same time ensuring a high level of data protection, digital rights and\nethical standards\u2019 5 .",

In its 2019 Conclusions on the Coordinated Plan on the\ndevelopment and use of artificial intelligence Made in Europe 6 , the Council\nfurther highlighted the importance of ensuring that European citizens\u2019 rights\nare fully respected and called for a review of the existing relevant\nlegislation to make it fit for purpose for the new opportunities and\nchallenges raised by AI. The European Council has also called for a clear\ndetermination of the AI applications that should be considered high-risk 7 .\n\nThe most recent Conclusions from 21 October 2020 further called for addressing\nthe opacity, complexity, bias, a certain degree of unpredictability and\npartially autonomous behaviour of certain AI systems, to ensure their\ncompatibility with fundamental rights and to facilitate the enforcement of\nlegal rules 8 .\n\nThe European Parliament has also undertaken a considerable amount of work in\nthe area of AI. In October 2020, it adopted a number of resolutions related to\nAI, including on ethics 9 , liability 10 and copyright 11 . In 2021, those\nwere followed by resolutions on AI in criminal matters 12 and in education,\nculture and the audio-visual sector 13 . The EP Resolution on a Framework of\nEthical Aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Related Technologies\nspecifically recommends to the Commission to propose legislative action to\nharness the opportunities and benefits of AI, but also to ensure protection of\nethical principles. The resolution includes a text of the legislative proposal\nfor a regulation on ethical principles for the development, deployment and use\nof AI, robotics and related technologies. In accordance with the political\ncommitment made by President von der Leyen in her Political Guidelines as\nregards resolutions adopted by the European Parliament under Article 225 TFEU,\nthis proposal takes into account the aforementioned resolution of the European\nParliament in full respect of proportionality, subsidiarity and better law\nmaking principles.\n\nAgainst this political context, the Commission puts forward the proposed\nregulatory framework on Artificial Intelligence with the following specific\nobjectives:\n\n\u00b7ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and\nrespect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values;\n\n\u00b7ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI;\n\n\u00b7enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental\nrights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems;\n\n\u00b7facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and\ntrustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation.\n\nTo achieve those objectives, this proposal presents a balanced and\nproportionate horizontal regulatory approach to AI that is limited to the\nminimum necessary requirements to address the risks and problems linked to AI,\nwithout unduly constraining or hindering technological development or\notherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on\nthe market. The proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework. On the\none hand, it is comprehensive and future-proof in its fundamental regulatory\nchoices, including the principle-based requirements that AI systems should\ncomply with. On the other hand, it puts in place a proportionate regulatory\nsystem centred on a well-defined risk-based regulatory approach that does not\ncreate unnecessary restrictions to trade, whereby legal intervention is\ntailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for\nconcern or where such concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near\nfuture. At the same time, the legal framework includes flexible mechanisms\nthat enable it to be dynamically adapted as the technology evolves and new\nconcerning situations emerge.\n\nThe proposal sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the\nmarket and use of AI systems in the Union following a proportionate risk-based\napproach. It proposes a single future-proof definition of AI. Certain\nparticularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as contravening Union values,\nwhile specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in relation to certain\nuses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law\nenforcement.",

It proposes a single future-proof definition of AI. Certain\nparticularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as contravening Union values,\nwhile specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in relation to certain\nuses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law\nenforcement. The proposal lays down a solid risk methodology to define \u201chigh-\nrisk\u201d AI systems that pose significant risks to the health and safety or\nfundamental rights of persons. Those AI systems will have to comply with a set\nof horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI and follow conformity\nassessment procedures before those systems can be placed on the Union market.\nPredictable, proportionate and clear obligations are also placed on providers\nand users of those systems to ensure safety and respect of existing\nlegislation protecting fundamental rights throughout the whole AI systems\u2019\nlifecycle. For some specific AI systems, only minimum transparency obligations\nare proposed, in particular when chatbots or \u2018deep fakes\u2019 are used.\n\nThe proposed rules will be enforced through a governance system at Member\nStates level, building on already existing structures, and a cooperation\nmechanism at Union level with the establishment of a European Artificial\nIntelligence Board. Additional measures are also proposed to support\ninnovation, in particular through AI regulatory sandboxes and other measures\nto reduce the regulatory burden and to support Small and Medium-Sized\nEnterprises (\u2018SMEs\u2019) and start-ups.\n\n1.2.Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\nThe horizontal nature of the proposal requires full consistency with existing\nUnion legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk AI systems are already\nused or likely to be used in the near future.\n\nConsistency is also ensured with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the\nexisting secondary Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection,\nnon-discrimination and gender equality. The proposal is without prejudice and\ncomplements the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)\nand the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) with a set of\nharmonised rules applicable to the design, development and use of certain\nhigh-risk AI systems and restrictions on certain uses of remote biometric\nidentification systems. Furthermore, the proposal complements existing Union\nlaw on non-discrimination with specific requirements that aim to minimise the\nrisk of algorithmic discrimination, in particular in relation to the design\nand the quality of data sets used for the development of AI systems\ncomplemented with obligations for testing, risk management, documentation and\nhuman oversight throughout the AI systems\u2019 lifecycle. The proposal is without\nprejudice to the application of Union competition law.\n\nAs regards high-risk AI systems which are safety components of products, this\nproposal will be integrated into the existing sectoral safety legislation to\nensure consistency, avoid duplications and minimise additional burdens. In\nparticular, as regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by the\nNew Legislative Framework (NLF) legislation (e.g. machinery, medical devices,\ntoys), the requirements for AI systems set out in this proposal will be\nchecked as part of the existing conformity assessment procedures under the\nrelevant NLF legislation. With regard to the interplay of requirements, while\nthe safety risks specific to AI systems are meant to be covered by the\nrequirements of this proposal, NLF legislation aims at ensuring the overall\nsafety of the final product and therefore may contain specific requirements\nregarding the safe integration of an AI system into the final product. The\nproposal for a Machinery Regulation, which is adopted on the same day as this\nproposal fully reflects this approach. As regards high-risk AI systems related\nto products covered by relevant Old Approach legislation (e.g. aviation,\ncars), this proposal would not directly apply. However, the ex-ante essential\nrequirements for high-risk AI systems set out in this proposal will have to be\ntaken into account when adopting relevant implementing or delegated\nlegislation under those acts.",

However, the ex-ante essential\nrequirements for high-risk AI systems set out in this proposal will have to be\ntaken into account when adopting relevant implementing or delegated\nlegislation under those acts.\n\nAs regards AI systems provided or used by regulated credit institutions, the\nauthorities responsible for the supervision of the Union\u2019s financial services\nlegislation should be designated as competent authorities for supervising the\nrequirements in this proposal to ensure a coherent enforcement of the\nobligations under this proposal and the Union\u2019s financial services legislation\nwhere AI systems are to some extent implicitly regulated in relation to the\ninternal governance system of credit institutions. To further enhance\nconsistency, the conformity assessment procedure and some of the providers\u2019\nprocedural obligations under this proposal are integrated into the procedures\nunder Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit institutions\nand the prudential supervision 14 .\n\nThis proposal is also consistent with the applicable Union legislation on\nservices, including on intermediary services regulated by the e-Commerce\nDirective 2000/31/EC 15 and the Commission\u2019s recent proposal for the Digital\nServices Act (DSA) 16 .\n\nIn relation to AI systems that are components of large-scale IT systems in the\nArea of Freedom, Security and Justice managed by the European Union Agency for\nthe Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA), the proposal\nwill not apply to those AI systems that have been placed on the market or put\ninto service before one year has elapsed from the date of application of this\nRegulation, unless the replacement or amendment of those legal acts leads to a\nsignificant change in the design or intended purpose of the AI system or AI\nsystems concerned.\n\n1.3.Consistency with other Union policies\n\nThe proposal is part of a wider comprehensive package of measures that address\nproblems posed by the development and use of AI, as examined in the White\nPaper on AI. Consistency and complementarity is therefore ensured with other\nongoing or planned initiatives of the Commission that also aim to address\nthose problems, including the revision of sectoral product legislation (e.g.\nthe Machinery Directive, the General Product Safety Directive) and initiatives\nthat address liability issues related to new technologies, including AI\nsystems. Those initiatives will build on and complement this proposal in order\nto bring legal clarity and foster the development of an ecosystem of trust in\nAI in Europe.\n\nThe proposal is also coherent with the Commission\u2019s overall digital strategy\nin its contribution to promoting technology that works for people, one of the\nthree main pillars of the policy orientation and objectives announced in the\nCommunication \u2018Shaping Europe's digital future\u2019 17 . It lays down a coherent,\neffective and proportionate framework to ensure AI is developed in ways that\nrespect people\u2019s rights and earn their trust, making Europe fit for the\ndigital age and turning the next ten years into the Digital Decade 18 .\n\nFurthermore, the promotion of AI-driven innovation is closely linked to the\nData Governance Act 19 , the Open Data Directive 20 and other initiatives\nunder the EU strategy for data 21 , which will establish trusted mechanisms\nand services for the re-use, sharing and pooling of data that are essential\nfor the development of data-driven AI models of high quality.\n\nThe proposal also strengthens significantly the Union\u2019s role to help shape\nglobal norms and standards and promote trustworthy AI that is consistent with\nUnion values and interests. It provides the Union with a powerful basis to\nengage further with its external partners, including third countries, and at\ninternational fora on issues relating to AI.\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n2.1.Legal basis\n\nThe legal basis for the proposal is in the first place Article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the\nadoption of measures to ensure the establishment and functioning of the\ninternal market.\n\nThis proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market\nstrategy.",

The primary objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market by setting harmonised rules in particular\non the development, placing on the Union market and the use of products and\nservices making use of AI technologies or provided as stand-alone AI systems.\nSome Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is\nsafe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights\nobligations. This will likely lead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of\nthe internal market on essential elements regarding in particular the\nrequirements for the AI products and services, their marketing, their use, the\nliability and the supervision by public authorities, and ii) the substantial\ndiminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on\nhow existing and new rules will apply to those systems in the Union. Given the\nwide circulation of products and services across borders, these two problems\ncan be best solved through EU harmonizing legislation.\n\nIndeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the\ndesign and development of certain AI systems before they are placed on the\nmarket that will be further operationalised through harmonised technical\nstandards. The proposal also addresses the situation after AI systems have\nbeen placed on the market by harmonising the way in which ex-post controls are\nconducted.\n\nIn addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data,\nnotably restrictions of the use of AI systems for \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric\nidentification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law\nenforcement, it is appropriate to base this regulation, in as far as those\nspecific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU.\n\n2.2.Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\nThe nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which\nmay be embedded in any product or service circulating freely within the\ninternal market, entails that the objectives of this proposal cannot be\neffectively achieved by Member States alone. Furthermore, an emerging\npatchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the seamless\ncirculation of products and services related to AI systems across the EU and\nwill be ineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental\nrights and Union values across the different Member States. National\napproaches in addressing the problems will only create additional legal\nuncertainty and barriers, and will slow market uptake of AI.\n\nThe objectives of this proposal can be better achieved at Union level to avoid\na further fragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory\nnational frameworks preventing the free circulation of goods and services\nembedding AI. A solid European regulatory framework for trustworthy AI will\nalso ensure a level playing field and protect all people, while strengthening\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Only common action at\nUnion level can also protect the Union\u2019s digital sovereignty and leverage its\ntools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards.\n\n2.3.Proportionality\n\nThe proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and\nnecessary to achieve its objectives, since it follows a risk-based approach\nand imposes regulatory burdens only when an AI system is likely to pose high\nrisks to fundamental rights and safety. For other, non-high-risk AI systems,\nonly very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for example in terms\nof the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when\ninteracting with humans. For high-risk AI systems, the requirements of high\nquality data, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight,\naccuracy and robustness, are strictly necessary to mitigate the risks to\nfundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that are not covered by other\nexisting legal frameworks. Harmonised standards and supporting guidance and\ncompliance tools will assist providers and users in complying with the\nrequirements laid down by the proposal and minimise their costs. The costs\nincurred by operators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the\neconomic and reputational benefits that operators can expect from this\nproposal.",

The costs\nincurred by operators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the\neconomic and reputational benefits that operators can expect from this\nproposal.\n\n2.4.Choice of the instrument\n\nThe choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for\na uniform application of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the\nprohibition of certain harmful AI-enabled practices and the classification of\ncertain AI systems. The direct applicability of a Regulation, in accordance\nwith Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and facilitate the\ndevelopment of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems. It\nwill do so, in particular, by introducing a harmonised set of core\nrequirements with regard to AI systems classified as high-risk and obligations\nfor providers and users of those systems, improving the protection of\nfundamental rights and providing legal certainty for operators and consumers\nalike.\n\nAt the same time, the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive\nand leave room for different levels of Member State action for elements that\ndo not undermine the objectives of the initiative, in particular the internal\norganisation of the market surveillance system and the uptake of measures to\nfoster innovation.\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT\nASSESSMENTS\n\n3.1.Stakeholder consultation\n\nThis proposal is the result of extensive consultation with all major\nstakeholders, in which the general principles and minimum standards for\nconsultation of interested parties by the Commission were applied.\n\nAn online public consultation was launched on 19 February 2020 along with the\npublication of the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and ran until 14\nJune 2020. The objective of that consultation was to collect views and\nopinions on the White Paper. It targeted all interested stakeholders from the\npublic and private sectors, including governments, local authorities,\ncommercial and non-commercial organisations, social partners, experts,\nacademics and citizens. After analysing all the responses received, the\nCommission published a summary outcome and the individual responses on its\nwebsite 22 .\n\nIn total, 1215 contributions were received, of which 352 were from companies\nor business organisations/associations, 406 from individuals (92%individuals\nfrom EU ), 152 on behalf of academic/research institutions, and 73 from public\nauthorities. Civil society\u2019s voices were represented by 160 respondents (among\nwhich 9 consumers\u2019 organisations, 129 non-governmental organisations and 22\ntrade unions), 72 respondents contributed as \u2018others\u2019. Of the 352 business and\nindustry representatives, 222 were companies and business representatives,\n41.5% of which were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The rest were\nbusiness associations. Overall, 84% of business and industry replies came from\nthe EU-27. Depending on the question, between 81 and 598 of the respondents\nused the free text option to insert comments. Over 450 position papers were\nsubmitted through the EU Survey website, either in addition to questionnaire\nanswers (over 400) or as stand-alone contributions (over 50).\n\nOverall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on a need for\naction. A large majority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or\nthat new legislation is needed. However, several stakeholders warn the\nCommission to avoid duplication, conflicting obligations and overregulation.\nThere were many comments underlining the importance of a technology neutral\nand proportionate regulatory framework.\n\nStakeholders mostly requested a narrow, clear and precise definition for AI.\nStakeholders also highlighted that besides the clarification of the term of\nAI, it is important to define \u2018risk\u2019, \u2018high-risk\u2019, \u2018low-risk\u2019, \u2018remote\nbiometric identification\u2019 and \u2018harm\u2019.\n\nMost of the respondents are explicitly in favour of the risk-based approach.\nUsing a risk-based framework was considered a better option than blanket\nregulation of all AI systems. The types of risks and threats should be based\non a sector-by-sector and case-by-case approach.",

Risks also should be\ncalculated taking into account the impact on rights and safety.\n\nRegulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of AI and are\nwelcomed by certain stakeholders, especially the Business Associations.\n\nAmong those who formulated their opinion on the enforcement models, more than\n50%, especially from the business associations, were in favour of a\ncombination of an ex-ante risk self-assessment and an ex-post enforcement for\nhigh-risk AI systems.\n\n3.2.Collection and use of expertise\n\nThe proposal builds on two years of analysis and close involvement of\nstakeholders, including academics, businesses, social partners, non-\ngovernmental organisations, Member States and citizens. The preparatory work\nstarted in 2018 with the setting up of a High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG)\nwhich had an inclusive and broad composition of 52 well-known experts tasked\nto advise the Commission on the implementation of the Commission\u2019s Strategy on\nArtificial Intelligence. In April 2019, the Commission supported 23 the key\nrequirements set out in the HLEG ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI 24 ,\nwhich had been revised to take into account more than 500 submissions from\nstakeholders. The key requirements reflect a widespread and common approach,\nas evidenced by a plethora of ethical codes and principles developed by many\nprivate and public organisations in Europe and beyond, that AI development and\nuse should be guided by certain essential value-oriented principles. The\nAssessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) 25 made those\nrequirements operational in a piloting process with over 350 organisations.\n\nIn addition, the AI Alliance 26 was formed as a platform for approximately\n4000 stakeholders to debate the technological and societal implications of AI,\nculminating in a yearly AI Assembly.\n\nThe White Paper on AI further developed this inclusive approach, inciting\ncomments from more than 1250 stakeholders, including over 450 additional\nposition papers. As a result, the Commission published an Inception Impact\nAssessment, which in turn attracted more than 130 comments 27 . Additional\nstakeholder workshops and events were also organised the results of which\nsupport the analysis in the impact assessment and the policy choices made in\nthis proposal 28 . An external study was also procured to feed into the impact\nassessment.\n\n3.3.Impact assessment\n\nIn line with its \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d policy, the Commission conducted an\nimpact assessment for this proposal examined by the Commission's Regulatory\nScrutiny Board. A meeting with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was held on 16\nDecember 2020, which was followed by a negative opinion. After substantial\nrevision of the impact assessment to address the comments and a resubmission\nof the impact assessment, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive\nopinion on 21 March 2021. The opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, the\nrecommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account\nare presented in Annex 1 of the impact assessment.\n\nThe Commission examined different policy options to achieve the general\nobjective of the proposal, which is to ensure the proper functioning of the\nsingle market by creating the conditions for the development and use of\ntrustworthy AI in the Union.\n\nFour policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were\nassessed:\n\n\u00b7Option 1: EU legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling scheme;\n\n\u00b7Option 2: a sectoral, \u201cad-hoc\u201d approach;\n\n\u00b7Option 3: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate\nrisk-based approach;\n\n\u00b7Option 3+: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate\nrisk-based approach + codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems;\n\n\u00b7Option 4: Horizontal EU legislative instrument establishing mandatory\nrequirements for all AI systems, irrespective of the risk they pose.",

The preferred option is option 3+, a regulatory\nframework for high-risk AI systems only, with the possibility for all\nproviders of non-high-risk AI systems to follow a code of conduct. The\nrequirements will concern data, documentation and traceability, provision of\ninformation and transparency, human oversight and robustness and accuracy and\nwould be mandatory for high-risk AI systems. Companies that introduced codes\nof conduct for other AI systems would do so voluntarily.\n\nThe preferred option was considered suitable to address in the most effective\nway the objectives of this proposal. By requiring a restricted yet effective\nset of actions from AI developers and users, the preferred option limits the\nrisks of violation of fundamental rights and safety of people and foster\neffective supervision and enforcement, by targeting the requirements only to\nsystems where there is a high risk that such violations could occur. As a\nresult, that option keeps compliance costs to a minimum, thus avoiding an\nunnecessary slowing of uptake due to higher prices and compliance costs. In\norder to address possible disadvantages for SMEs, this option includes several\nprovisions to support their compliance and reduce their costs, including\ncreation of regulatory sandboxes and obligation to consider SMEs interests\nwhen setting fees related to conformity assessment.\n\nThe preferred option will increase people\u2019s trust in AI, companies will gain\nin legal certainty, and Member States will see no reason to take unilateral\naction that could fragment the single market. As a result of higher demand due\nto higher trust, more available offers due to legal certainty, and the absence\nof obstacles to cross-border movement of AI systems, the single market for AI\nwill likely flourish. The European Union will continue to develop a fast-\ngrowing AI ecosystem of innovative services and products embedding AI\ntechnology or stand-alone AI systems, resulting in increased digital autonomy.\n\nBusinesses or public authorities that develop or use AI applications that\nconstitute a high risk for the safety or fundamental rights of citizens would\nhave to comply with specific requirements and obligations. Compliance with\nthese requirements would imply costs amounting to approximately EUR \u20ac 6000 to\nEUR \u20ac 7000 for the supply of an average high-risk AI system of around EUR \u20ac\n170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the annual cost for the time\nspent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate, depending on the\nuse case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR \u20ac 5000 to EUR \u20ac 8000\nper year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR \u20ac 3000 to EUR \u20ac 7500\nfor suppliers of high-risk AI. Businesses or public authorities that develop\nor use any AI applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal\nobligations of information. However, they could choose to join others and\ntogether adopt a code of conduct to follow suitable requirements, and to\nensure that their AI systems are trustworthy. In such a case, costs would be\nat most as high as for high-risk AI systems, but most probably lower.\n\nThe impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders\n(economic operators/ business; conformity assessment bodies, standardisation\nbodies and other public bodies; individuals/citizens; researchers) are\nexplained in detail in Annex 3 of the Impact assessment supporting this\nproposal.\n\n3.4.Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\nThis proposal lays down obligation that will apply to providers and users of\nhigh-risk AI systems.

For providers who develop and place such systems on the\nUnion market, it will create legal certainty and ensure that no obstacle to\nthe cross-border provision of AI-related services and products emerge. For\ncompanies using AI, it will promote trust among their customers. For national\npublic administrations, it will promote public trust in the use of AI and\nstrengthen enforcement mechanisms (by introducing a European coordination\nmechanism, providing for appropriate capacities, and facilitating audits of\nthe AI systems with new requirements for documentation, traceability and\ntransparency). Moreover, the framework will envisage specific measures\nsupporting innovation, including regulatory sandboxes and specific measures\nsupporting small-scale users and providers of high-risk AI systems to comply\nwith the new rules.\n\nThe proposal also specifically aims at strengthening Europe\u2019s competitiveness\nand industrial basis in AI. Full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral\nUnion legislation applicable to AI systems (e.g. on products and services)\nthat will bring further clarity and simplify the enforcement of the new rules.\n\n3.5.Fundamental rights\n\nThe use of AI with its specific characteristics (e.g. opacity, complexity,\ndependency on data, autonomous behaviour) can adversely affect a number of\nfundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (\u2018the\nCharter\u2019). This proposal seeks to ensure a high level of protection for those\nfundamental rights and aims to address various sources of risks through a\nclearly defined risk-based approach. With a set of requirements for\ntrustworthy AI and proportionate obligations on all value chain participants,\nthe proposal will enhance and promote the protection of the rights protected\nby the Charter: the right to human dignity (Article 1), respect for private\nlife and protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8), non-discrimination\n(Article 21) and equality between women and men (Article 23). It aims to\nprevent a chilling effect on the rights to freedom of expression (Article 11)\nand freedom of assembly (Article 12), to ensure protection of the right to an\neffective remedy and to a fair trial, the rights of defence and the\npresumption of innocence (Articles 47 and 48), as well as the general\nprinciple of good administration. Furthermore, as applicable in certain\ndomains, the proposal will positively affect the rights of a number of special\ngroups, such as the workers\u2019 rights to fair and just working conditions\n(Article 31), a high level of consumer protection (Article 28), the rights of\nthe child (Article 24) and the integration of persons with disabilities\n(Article 26). The right to a high level of environmental protection and the\nimprovement of the quality of the environment (Article 37) is also relevant,\nincluding in relation to the health and safety of people. The obligations for\nex ante testing, risk management and human oversight will also facilitate the\nrespect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or\nbiased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training,\nemployment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary. In case\ninfringements of fundamental rights still happen, effective redress for\naffected persons will be made possible by ensuring transparency and\ntraceability of the AI systems coupled with strong ex post controls.\n\nThis proposal imposes some restrictions on the freedom to conduct business\n(Article 16) and the freedom of art and science (Article 13) to ensure\ncompliance with overriding reasons of public interest such as health, safety,\nconsumer protection and the protection of other fundamental rights\n(\u2018responsible innovation\u2019) when high-risk AI technology is developed and used.\nThose restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to\nprevent and mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of\nfundamental rights.",
        "748908de-d1bd-47f7-8dee-189d44943fc2": "In case\ninfringements of fundamental rights still happen, effective redress for\naffected persons will be made possible by ensuring transparency and\ntraceability of the AI systems coupled with strong ex post controls.\n\nThis proposal imposes some restrictions on the freedom to conduct business\n(Article 16) and the freedom of art and science (Article 13) to ensure\ncompliance with overriding reasons of public interest such as health, safety,\nconsumer protection and the protection of other fundamental rights\n(\u2018responsible innovation\u2019) when high-risk AI technology is developed and used.\nThose restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to\nprevent and mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of\nfundamental rights.\n\nThe increased transparency obligations will also not disproportionately affect\nthe right to protection of intellectual property (Article 17(2)), since they\nwill be limited only to the minimum necessary information for individuals to\nexercise their right to an effective remedy and to the necessary transparency\ntowards supervision and enforcement authorities, in line with their mandates.\nAny disclosure of information will be carried out in compliance with relevant\nlegislation in the field, including Directive 2016/943 on the protection of\nundisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their\nunlawful acquisition, use and disclosure. When public authorities and notified\nbodies need to be given access to confidential information or source code to\nexamine compliance with substantial obligations, they are placed under binding\nconfidentiality obligations.\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\nMember States will have to designate supervisory authorities in charge of\nimplementing the legislative requirements. Their supervisory function could\nbuild on existing arrangements, for example regarding conformity assessment\nbodies or market surveillance, but would require sufficient technological\nexpertise and human and financial resources. Depending on the pre-existing\nstructure in each Member State, this could amount to 1 to 25 Full Time\nEquivalents per Member State.\n\nA detailed overview of the costs involved is provided in the \u2018financial\nstatement\u2019 linked to this proposal.\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n5.1.Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\nProviding for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to\nensure that the proposal will be effective in achieving its specific\nobjectives. The Commission will be in charge of monitoring the effects of the\nproposal. It will establish a system for registering stand-alone high-risk AI\napplications in a public EU-wide database. This registration will also enable\ncompetent authorities, users and other interested people to verify if the\nhigh-risk AI system complies with the requirements laid down in the proposal\nand to exercise enhanced oversight over those AI systems posing high risks to\nfundamental rights. To feed this database, AI providers will be obliged to\nprovide meaningful information about their systems and the conformity\nassessment carried out on those systems.\n\nMoreover, AI providers will be obliged to inform national competent\nauthorities about serious incidents or malfunctioning that constitute a breach\nof fundamental rights obligations as soon as they become aware of them, as\nwell as any recalls or withdrawals of AI systems from the market. National\ncompetent authorities will then investigate the incidents/or malfunctioning,\ncollect all the necessary information and regularly transmit it to the\nCommission with adequate metadata. The Commission will complement this\ninformation on the incidents by a comprehensive analysis of the overall market\nfor AI.\n\nThe Commission will publish a report evaluating and reviewing the proposed AI\nframework five years following the date on which it becomes applicable.\n\n5.2.Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n5.2.1.SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS (TITLE I)\n\nTitle I defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of\napplication of the new rules that cover the placing on the market, putting\ninto service and use of AI systems. It also sets out the definitions used\nthroughout the instrument. The definition of AI system in the legal framework\naims to be as technology neutral and future proof as possible, taking into\naccount the fast technological and market developments related to AI. In order\nto provide the needed legal certainty, Title I is complemented by Annex I,\nwhich contains a detailed list of approaches and techniques for the\ndevelopment of AI to be adapted by the Commission in line with new\ntechnological developments. Key participants across the AI value chain are\nalso clearly defined such as providers and users of AI systems that cover both\npublic and private operators to ensure a level playing field.\n\n5.2.2.PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES (TITLE II)\n\nTitle II establishes a list of prohibited AI.",
        "42cffcb5-e37a-44fe-bee9-32f24aadf256": "It also sets out the definitions used\nthroughout the instrument.

Key participants across the AI value chain are\nalso clearly defined such as providers and users of AI systems that cover both\npublic and private operators to ensure a level playing field.\n\n5.2.2.PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES (TITLE II)\n\nTitle II establishes a list of prohibited AI. The regulation follows a risk-\nbased approach, differentiating between uses of AI that create (i) an\nunacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii) low or minimal risk. The list\nof prohibited practices in Title II comprises all those AI systems whose use\nis considered unacceptable as contravening Union values, for instance by\nviolating fundamental rights. The prohibitions covers practices that have a\nsignificant potential to manipulate persons through subliminal techniques\nbeyond their consciousness or exploit vulnerabilities of specific vulnerable\ngroups such as children or persons with disabilities in order to materially\ndistort their behaviour in a manner that is likely to cause them or another\nperson psychological or physical harm. Other manipulative or exploitative\npractices affecting adults that might be facilitated by AI systems could be\ncovered by the existing data protection, consumer protection and digital\nservice legislation that guarantee that natural persons are properly informed\nand have free choice not to be subject to profiling or other practices that\nmight affect their behaviour. The proposal also prohibits AI-based social\nscoring for general purposes done by public authorities. Finally, the use of\n\u2018real time\u2019 remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible\nspaces for the purpose of law enforcement is also prohibited unless certain\nlimited exceptions apply.\n\n5.2.3.HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS (TITLE III)\n\nTitle III contains specific rules for AI systems that create a high risk to\nthe health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons. In line with a\nrisk-based approach, those high-risk AI systems are permitted on the European\nmarket subject to compliance with certain mandatory requirements and an ex-\nante conformity assessment. The classification of an AI system as high-risk is\nbased on the intended purpose of the AI system, in line with existing product\nsafety legislation. Therefore, the classification as high-risk does not only\ndepend on the function performed by the AI system, but also on the specific\npurpose and modalities for which that system is used.\n\nChapter 1 of Title III sets the classification rules and identifies two main\ncategories of high-risk AI systems:\n\n\u00b7AI systems intended to be used as safety component of products that are\nsubject to third party ex-ante conformity assessment;\n\n\u00b7other stand-alone AI systems with mainly fundamental rights implications that\nare explicitly listed in Annex III.\n\nThis list of high-risk AI systems in Annex III contains a limited number of AI\nsystems whose risks have already materialised or are likely to materialise in\nthe near future. To ensure that the regulation can be adjusted to emerging\nuses and applications of AI, the Commission may expand the list of high-risk\nAI systems used within certain pre-defined areas, by applying a set of\ncriteria and risk assessment methodology.\n\nChapter 2 sets out the legal requirements for high-risk AI systems in relation\nto data and data governance, documentation and recording keeping, transparency\nand provision of information to users, human oversight, robustness, accuracy\nand security. The proposed minimum requirements are already state-of-the-art\nfor many diligent operators and the result of two years of preparatory work,\nderived from the Ethics Guidelines of the HLEG 29 , piloted by more than 350\norganisations 30 . They are also largely consistent with other international\nrecommendations and principles, which ensures that the proposed AI framework\nis compatible with those adopted by the EU\u2019s international trade partners. The\nprecise technical solutions to achieve compliance with those requirements may\nbe provided by standards or by other technical specifications or otherwise be\ndeveloped in accordance with general engineering or scientific knowledge at\nthe discretion of the provider of the AI system. This flexibility is\nparticularly important, because it allows providers of AI systems to choose\nthe way to meet their requirements, taking into account the state-of-the-art\nand technological and scientific progress in this field.\n\nChapter 3 places a clear set of horizontal obligations on providers of high-\nrisk AI systems.",
        "d2b4f960-b43e-402b-9037-da3f6e8fbc9f": "The proposed minimum requirements are already state-of-the-art\nfor many diligent operators and the result of two years of preparatory work,\nderived from the Ethics Guidelines of the HLEG 29 , piloted by more than 350\norganisations 30 .

This flexibility is\nparticularly important, because it allows providers of AI systems to choose\nthe way to meet their requirements, taking into account the state-of-the-art\nand technological and scientific progress in this field.\n\nChapter 3 places a clear set of horizontal obligations on providers of high-\nrisk AI systems. Proportionate obligations are also placed on users and other\nparticipants across the AI value chain (e.g., importers, distributors,\nauthorized representatives).\n\nChapter 4 sets the framework for notified bodies to be involved as independent\nthird parties in conformity assessment procedures, while Chapter 5 explains in\ndetail the conformity assessment procedures to be followed for each type of\nhigh-risk AI system. The conformity assessment approach aims to minimise the\nburden for economic operators as well as for notified bodies, whose capacity\nneeds to be progressively ramped up over time. AI systems intended to be used\nas safety components of products that are regulated under the New Legislative\nFramework legislation (e.g. machinery, toys, medical devices, etc.) will be\nsubject to the same ex-ante and ex-post compliance and enforcement mechanisms\nof the products of which they are a component. The key difference is that the\nex-ante and ex-post mechanisms will ensure compliance not only with the\nrequirements established by sectorial legislation, but also with the\nrequirements established by this regulation.\n\nAs regards stand-alone high-risk AI systems that are referred to in Annex III,\na new compliance and enforcement system will be established. This follows the\nmodel of the New Legislative Framework legislation implemented through\ninternal control checks by the providers with the exception of remote\nbiometric identification systems that would be subject to third party\nconformity assessment. A comprehensive ex-ante conformity assessment through\ninternal checks, combined with a strong ex-post enforcement, could be an\neffective and reasonable solution for those systems, given the early phase of\nthe regulatory intervention and the fact the AI sector is very innovative and\nexpertise for auditing is only now being accumulated. An assessment through\ninternal checks for \u2018stand-alone\u2019 high-risk AI systems would require a full,\neffective and properly documented ex ante compliance with all requirements of\nthe regulation and compliance with robust quality and risk management systems\nand post-market monitoring. After the provider has performed the relevant\nconformity assessment, it should register those stand-alone high-risk AI\nsystems in an EU database that will be managed by the Commission to increase\npublic transparency and oversight and strengthen ex post supervision by\ncompetent authorities. By contrast, for reasons of consistency with the\nexisting product safety legislation, the conformity assessments of AI systems\nthat are safety components of products will follow a system with third party\nconformity assessment procedures already established under the relevant\nsectoral product safety legislation. New ex ante re-assessments of the\nconformity will be needed in case of substantial modifications to the AI\nsystems (and notably changes which go beyond what is pre-determined by the\nprovider in its technical documentation and checked at the moment of the ex-\nante conformity assessment).\n\n5.2.4.TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS (TITLE IV)\n\nTitle IV concerns certain AI systems to take account of the specific risks of\nmanipulation they pose. Transparency obligations will apply for systems that\n(i) interact with humans, (ii) are used to detect emotions or determine\nassociation with (social) categories based on biometric data, or (iii)\ngenerate or manipulate content (\u2018deep fakes\u2019). When persons interact with an\nAI system or their emotions or characteristics are recognised through\nautomated means, people must be informed of that circumstance. If an AI system\nis used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that\nappreciably resembles authentic content, there should be an obligation to\ndisclose that the content is generated through automated means, subject to\nexceptions for legitimate purposes (law enforcement, freedom of expression).\nThis allows persons to make informed choices or step back from a given\nsituation.",
        "7e60f260-6f64-4516-b132-94eca43d06ab": "Transparency obligations will apply for systems that\n(i) interact with humans, (ii) are used to detect emotions or determine\nassociation with (social) categories based on biometric data, or (iii)\ngenerate or manipulate content (\u2018deep fakes\u2019).

To that end, it\nencourages national competent authorities to set up regulatory sandboxes and\nsets a basic framework in terms of governance, supervision and liability. AI\nregulatory sandboxes establish a controlled environment to test innovative\ntechnologies for a limited time on the basis of a testing plan agreed with the\ncompetent authorities. Title V also contains measures to reduce the regulatory\nburden on SMEs and start-ups.\n\n5.2.6.GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION (TITLES VI, VII AND VII)\n\nTitle VI sets up the governance systems at Union and national level. At Union\nlevel, the proposal establishes a European Artificial Intelligence Board (the\n\u2018Board\u2019), composed of representatives from the Member States and the\nCommission. The Board will facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised\nimplementation of this regulation by contributing to the effective cooperation\nof the national supervisory authorities and the Commission and providing\nadvice and expertise to the Commission. It will also collect and share best\npractices among the Member States.\n\nAt national level, Member States will have to designate one or more national\ncompetent authorities and, among them, the national supervisory authority, for\nthe purpose of supervising the application and implementation of the\nregulation. The European Data Protection Supervisor will act as the competent\nauthority for the supervision of the Union institutions, agencies and bodies\nwhen they fall within the scope of this regulation.\n\nTitle VII aims to facilitate the monitoring work of the Commission and\nnational authorities through the establishment of an EU-wide database for\nstand-alone high-risk AI systems with mainly fundamental rights implications.\nThe database will be operated by the Commission and provided with data by the\nproviders of the AI systems, who will be required to register their systems\nbefore placing them on the market or otherwise putting them into service.\n\nTitle VIII sets out the monitoring and reporting obligations for providers of\nAI systems with regard to post-market monitoring and reporting and\ninvestigating on AI-related incidents and malfunctioning. Market surveillance\nauthorities would also control the market and investigate compliance with the\nobligations and requirements for all high-risk AI systems already placed on\nthe market. Market surveillance authorities would have all powers under\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance. Ex-post enforcement should\nensure that once the AI system has been put on the market, public authorities\nhave the powers and resources to intervene in case AI systems generate\nunexpected risks, which warrant rapid action. They will also monitor\ncompliance of operators with their relevant obligations under the regulation.\nThe proposal does not foresee the automatic creation of any additional bodies\nor authorities at Member State level. Member States may therefore appoint (and\ndraw upon the expertise of) existing sectorial authorities, who would be\nentrusted also with the powers to monitor and enforce the provisions of the\nregulation.\n\nAll this is without prejudice to the existing system and allocation of powers\nof ex-post enforcement of obligations regarding fundamental rights in the\nMember States. When necessary for their mandate, existing supervision and\nenforcement authorities will also have the power to request and access any\ndocumentation maintained following this regulation and, where needed, request\nmarket surveillance authorities to organise testing of the high-risk AI system\nthrough technical means.\n\n5.2.7.CODES OF CONDUCT (TITLE IX)\n\nTitle IX creates a framework for the creation of codes of conduct, which aim\nto encourage providers of non-high-risk AI systems to apply voluntarily the\nmandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems (as laid out in Title III).\nProviders of non-high-risk AI systems may create and implement the codes of\nconduct themselves.",

Those codes may also include voluntary commitments\nrelated, for example, to environmental sustainability, accessibility for\npersons with disability, stakeholders\u2019 participation in the design and\ndevelopment of AI systems, and diversity of development teams.\n\n5.2.8.FINAL PROVISIONS (TITLES X, XI AND XII)\n\nTitle X emphasizes the obligation of all parties to respect the\nconfidentiality of information and data and sets out rules for the exchange of\ninformation obtained during the implementation of the regulation. Title X also\nincludes measures to ensure the effective implementation of the regulation\nthrough effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties for infringements\nof the provisions.\n\nTitle XI sets out rules for the exercise of delegation and implementing\npowers. The proposal empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate,\nimplementing acts to ensure uniform application of the regulation or delegated\nacts to update or complement the lists in Annexes I to VII.\n\nTitle XII contains an obligation for the Commission to assess regularly the\nneed for an update of Annex III and to prepare regular reports on the\nevaluation and review of the regulation. It also lays down final provisions,\nincluding a differentiated transitional period for the initial date of the\napplicability of the regulation to facilitate the smooth implementation for\nall parties concerned.\n\n2021/0106 (COD)\n\nProposal for a\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nLAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL\nINTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in\nparticular Articles 16 and 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 31\n,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 32 ,\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the\ninternal market by laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the\ndevelopment, marketing and use of artificial intelligence in conformity with\nUnion values. This Regulation pursues a number of overriding reasons of public\ninterest, such as a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental\nrights, and it ensures the free movement of AI-based goods and services cross-\nborder, thus preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the\ndevelopment, marketing and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorised by\nthis Regulation.\n\n(2)Artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) can be easily deployed in\nmultiple sectors of the economy and society, including cross border, and\ncirculate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored\nthe adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe\nand is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations.\nDiffering national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and\ndecrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use AI systems. A\nconsistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore\nbe ensured, while divergences hampering the free circulation of AI systems and\nrelated products and services within the internal market should be prevented,\nby laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform\nprotection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons\nthroughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU).",

To the extent that this Regulation\ncontains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems\nfor \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces\nfor the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation,\nin as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In\nlight of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is\nappropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.\n\n(3)Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that can\ncontribute to a wide array of economic and societal benefits across the entire\nspectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction,\noptimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising digital\nsolutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of artificial\nintelligence can provide key competitive advantages to companies and support\nsocially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare,\nfarming, education and training, infrastructure management, energy, transport\nand logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy\nefficiency, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n(4)At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific\napplication and use, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause harm\nto public interests and rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm\nmight be material or immaterial.\n\n(5)A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial\nintelligence is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of\nartificial intelligence in the internal market that at the same time meets a\nhigh level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and\nthe protection of fundamental rights, as recognised and protected by Union\nlaw. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market and\nputting into service of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring\nthe smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to\nbenefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. By laying\ndown those rules, this Regulation supports the objective of the Union of being\na global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical\nartificial intelligence, as stated by the European Council 33 , and it ensures\nthe protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the\nEuropean Parliament 34 .\n\n(6)The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal\ncertainty, while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological\ndevelopments. The definition should be based on the key functional\ncharacteristics of the software, in particular the ability, for a given set of\nhuman-defined objectives, to generate outputs such as content, predictions,\nrecommendations, or decisions which influence the environment with which the\nsystem interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension. AI systems can be\ndesigned to operate with varying levels of autonomy and be used on a stand-\nalone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system\nis physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the\nfunctionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded).\nThe definition of AI system should be complemented by a list of specific\ntechniques and approaches used for its development, which should be kept up-\nto\u2013date in the light of market and technological developments through the\nadoption of delegated acts by the Commission to amend that list.",

Considering their different\ncharacteristics and manners in which they are used, as well as the different\nrisks involved, a distinction should be made between \u2018real-time\u2019 and \u2018post\u2019\nremote biometric identification systems. In the case of \u2018real-time\u2019 systems,\nthe capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification\noccur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a\nsignificant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing\nthe rules of this Regulation on the \u2018real-time\u2019 use of the AI systems in\nquestion by providing for minor delays. \u2018Real-time\u2019 systems involve the use of\n\u2018live\u2019 or \u2018near-\u2018live\u2019 material, such as video footage, generated by a camera\nor other device with similar functionality. In the case of \u2018post\u2019 systems, in\ncontrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and\nidentification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material,\nsuch as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television\ncameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the\nsystem in respect of the natural persons concerned.\n\n(9)For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space\nshould be understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to\nthe public, irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or\npublicly owned. Therefore, the notion does not cover places that are private\nin nature and normally not freely accessible for third parties, including law\nenforcement authorities, unless those parties have been specifically invited\nor authorised, such as homes, private clubs, offices, warehouses and\nfactories. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical\nspaces. However, the mere fact that certain conditions for accessing a\nparticular space may apply, such as admission tickets or age restrictions,\ndoes not mean that the space is not publicly accessible within the meaning of\nthis Regulation. Consequently, in addition to public spaces such as streets,\nrelevant parts of government buildings and most transport infrastructure,\nspaces such as cinemas, theatres, shops and shopping centres are normally also\npublicly accessible. Whether a given space is accessible to the public should\nhowever be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the\nspecificities of the individual situation at hand.\n\n(10)In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of\nrights and freedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by\nthis Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-\ndiscriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the\nUnion or in a third country, and to users of AI systems established within the\nUnion.",

This is the case for example of\nan operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an\noperator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be\nperformed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk and whose effects\nimpact natural persons located in the Union. In those circumstances, the AI\nsystem used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully\ncollected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting\noperator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that\nprocessing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into\nservice or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation\nand to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union,\nthis Regulation should also apply to providers and users of AI systems that\nare established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those\nsystems is used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing\narrangements and special needs for cooperation with foreign partners with whom\ninformation and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to\npublic authorities of a third country and international organisations when\nacting in the framework of international agreements concluded at national or\nEuropean level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or\nwith its Member States. Such agreements have been concluded bilaterally\nbetween Member States and third countries or between the European Union,\nEuropol and other EU agencies and third countries and international\norganisations.\n\n(12)This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies\nand agencies when acting as a provider or user of an AI system. AI systems\nexclusively developed or used for military purposes should be excluded from\nthe scope of this Regulation where that use falls under the exclusive remit of\nthe Common Foreign and Security Policy regulated under Title V of the Treaty\non the European Union (TEU). This Regulation should be without prejudice to\nthe provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set\nout in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as\namended by the Digital Services Act].\n\n(13)In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public\ninterests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common normative\nstandards for all high-risk AI systems should be established. Those standards\nshould be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the European\nUnion (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the\nUnion\u2019s international trade commitments.\n\n(14)In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules\nfor AI systems, a clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That\napproach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and\nscope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to\nprohibit certain artificial intelligence practices, to lay down requirements\nfor high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to\nlay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.\n\n(15)Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that\ntechnology can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for\nmanipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices are\nparticularly harmful and should be prohibited because they contradict Union\nvalues of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule\nof law and Union fundamental rights, including the right to non-\ndiscrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child.\n\n(16)The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI\nsystems intended to distort human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological\nharms are likely to occur, should be forbidden.",

They\ndo so with the intention to materially distort the behaviour of a person and\nin a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person.\nThe intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results\nfrom factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the\nprovider or the user. Research for legitimate purposes in relation to such AI\nsystems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not\namount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural\npersons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised\nethical standards for scientific research.\n\n(17)AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purpose\nby public authorities or on their behalf may lead to discriminatory outcomes\nand the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and\nnon-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems\nevaluate or classify the trustworthiness of natural persons based on their\nsocial behaviour in multiple contexts or known or predicted personal or\npersonality characteristics. The social score obtained from such AI systems\nmay lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or\nwhole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in\nwhich the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental\ntreatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their\nsocial behaviour. Such AI systems should be therefore prohibited.\n\n(18)The use of AI systems for \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification of\nnatural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law\nenforcement is considered particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of\nthe concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a\nlarge part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and\nindirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other\nfundamental rights. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited\nopportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such\nsystems operating in \u2018real-time\u2019 carry heightened risks for the rights and\nfreedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.\n\n(19)The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should\ntherefore be prohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly\ndefined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a\nsubstantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks.\nThose situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including\nmissing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural\npersons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation,\nidentification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal\noffences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA 38 if those\ncriminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial\nsentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and\nas they are defined in the law of that Member State.

        "eb05be6d-82cf-402a-ac4d-cecbb979ddb8": "Those situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including\nmissing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural\npersons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation,\nidentification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal\noffences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA 38 if those\ncriminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial\nsentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and\nas they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the\ncustodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law\ncontributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially\njustify the use of \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification systems.\nMoreover, of the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision\n2002/584/JHA, some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in\nthat the recourse to \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification will\nforeseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the\npractical pursuit of the detection, localisation, identification or\nprosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences\nlisted and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness,\nprobability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.\n\n(20)In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and\nproportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those\nthree exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements\nshould be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the\nsituation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the\nrights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions\nprovided for with the use. In addition, the use of \u2018real-time\u2019 remote\nbiometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose\nof law enforcement should be subject to appropriate limits in time and space,\nhaving regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the\nthreats, the victims or perpetrator. The reference database of persons should\nbe appropriate for each use case in each of the three situations mentioned\nabove.\n\n(21)Each use of a \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification system in\npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be\nsubject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by\nan independent administrative authority of a Member State. Such authorisation\nshould in principle be obtained prior to the use, except in duly justified\nsituations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems\nin question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to\nobtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of\nurgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be\nsubject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national\nlaw and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law\nenforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority\nshould in such situations seek to obtain an authorisation as soon as possible,\nwhilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier.\n\n(22)Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework\nset by this Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in\naccordance with this Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as\nthe Member State in question has decided to expressly provide for the\npossibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of national law.\nConsequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide\nfor such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in\nrespect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use\nidentified in this Regulation.\n\n(23)The use of AI systems for \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification of\nnatural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law\nenforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data.

Therefore, such use and\nprocessing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the\nframework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that\nframework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law\nenforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto\non the grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.

For instance, increasingly autonomous robots,\nwhether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should\nbe able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex\nenvironments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and\nhealth are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems\nand systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. The\nextent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights\nprotected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI\nsystem as high-risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect\nfor private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of\nexpression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, and non-\ndiscrimination, consumer protection, workers\u2019 rights, rights of persons with\ndisabilities, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of\ndefence and the presumption of innocence, right to good administration. In\naddition to those rights, it is important to highlight that children have\nspecific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and in the United\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the UNCRC\nGeneral Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which\nrequire consideration of the children\u2019s vulnerabilities and provision of such\nprotection and care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right\nto a high level of environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and\nimplemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the\nseverity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to the\nhealth and safety of persons.\n\n(29)As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or\nsystems, or which are themselves products or systems falling within the scope\nof Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n39 , Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n40 , Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n41 , Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 42 ,\nDirective (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council 43 ,\nRegulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council 44 ,\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council 45 ,\nand Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council 46\n, it is appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes\ninto account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of\neach sector, and without interfering with existing governance, conformity\nassessment and enforcement mechanisms and authorities established therein, the\nmandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid down in this Regulation\nwhen adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts on the basis\nof those acts.\n\n(30)As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are\nthemselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation\nlegislation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this\nRegulation if the product in question undergoes the conformity assessment\nprocedure with a third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that\nrelevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular, such products are\nmachinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use in\npotentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment,\nrecreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning\ngaseous fuels, medical devices, and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.",

This is notably the case for\nRegulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 and\nRegulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 ,\nwhere a third-party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and\nhigh-risk products.\n\n(32)As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than\nthose that are safety components of products, or which are themselves\nproducts, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in the light of\ntheir intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety\nor the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of\nthe possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a\nnumber of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The\nidentification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria\nenvisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems.\n\n(33)Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric\nidentification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail\ndiscriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age,\nethnicity, sex or disabilities. Therefore, \u2018real-time\u2019 and \u2018post\u2019 remote\nbiometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk. In view of\nthe risks that they pose, both types of remote biometric identification\nsystems should be subject to specific requirements on logging capabilities and\nhuman oversight.\n\n(34)As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is\nappropriate to classify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as\nsafety components in the management and operation of road traffic and the\nsupply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or\nmalfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of persons at large scale\nand lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social and\neconomic activities.\n\n(35)AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for\ndetermining access or assigning persons to educational and vocational training\ninstitutions or to evaluate persons on tests as part of or as a precondition\nfor their education should be considered high-risk, since they may determine\nthe educational and professional course of a person\u2019s life and therefore\naffect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and\nused, such systems may violate the right to education and training as well as\nthe right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns\nof discrimination.\n\n(36)AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-\nemployment, notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making\ndecisions on promotion and termination and for task allocation, monitoring or\nevaluation of persons in work-related contractual relationships, should also\nbe classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably impact future\ncareer prospects and livelihoods of these persons. Relevant work-related\ncontractual relationships should involve employees and persons providing\nservices through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme\n2021.

AI systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these\npersons may also impact their rights to data protection and privacy.\n\n(37)Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration\nis the access to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public\nservices and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or\nto improve one\u2019s standard of living. In particular, AI systems used to\nevaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be\nclassified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons\u2019 access\nto financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and\ntelecommunication services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to\ndiscrimination of persons or groups and perpetuate historical patterns of\ndiscrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic origins, disabilities,\nage, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory impacts.\nConsidering the very limited scale of the impact and the available\nalternatives on the market, it is appropriate to exempt AI systems for the\npurpose of creditworthiness assessment and credit scoring when put into\nservice by small-scale providers for their own use. Natural persons applying\nfor or receiving public assistance benefits and services from public\nauthorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a\nvulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems\nare used for determining whether such benefits and services should be denied,\nreduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, they may have a significant\nimpact on persons\u2019 livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such\nas the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity or an\neffective remedy. Those systems should therefore be classified as high-risk.\nNonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the development and use of\ninnovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to\nbenefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those\nsystems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. Finally, AI\nsystems used to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency\nfirst response services should also be classified as high-risk since they make\ndecisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and\ntheir property.\n\n(38)Actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI\nsystems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may\nlead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person\u2019s liberty as\nwell as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter.\nIn particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does\nnot meet adequate requirements in terms of its accuracy or robustness, or is\nnot properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise\nput into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise\nincorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural\nfundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair\ntrial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could\nbe hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently\ntransparent, explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to\nclassify as high-risk a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law\nenforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is\nparticularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and\nensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the\nactivities in question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI\nsystems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by law\nenforcement authorities for individual risk assessments, polygraphs and\nsimilar tools or to detect the emotional state of natural person, to detect\n\u2018deep fakes\u2019, for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in criminal\nproceedings, for predicting the occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or\npotential criminal offence based on profiling of natural persons, or assessing\npersonality traits and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural\npersons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or\nprosecution of criminal offences, as well as for crime analytics regarding\nnatural persons.",

AI systems in the\narea of migration, asylum and border control management covered by this\nRegulation should comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the\nDirective 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 , the\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 50\nand other relevant legislation.\n\n(40)Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and\ndemocratic processes should be classified as high-risk, considering their\npotentially significant impact on democracy, rule of law, individual freedoms\nas well as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial.

In order\nto protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from\nthe bias in AI systems, the providers shouldbe able to process also special\ncategories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest, in\norder to ensure the bias monitoring, detection and correction in relation to\nhigh-risk AI systems.\n\n(45)For the development of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as\nproviders, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital\ninnovation hubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers, should be\nable to access and use high quality datasets within their respective fields of\nactivities which are related to this Regulation. European common data spaces\nestablished by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing between\nbusinesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to\nprovide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high quality\ndata for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in\nhealth, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory\naccess to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms\non those datasets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and\ntrustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance. Relevant\ncompetent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing or supporting the\naccess to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the\ntraining, validation and testing of AI systems.\n\n(46)Having information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how\nthey perform throughout their lifecycle is essential to verify compliance with\nthe requirements under this Regulation. This requires keeping records and the\navailability of a technical documentation, containing information which is\nnecessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant\nrequirements. Such information should include the general characteristics,\ncapabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training,\ntesting and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant\nrisk management system.

Failure to protect\nagainst these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the\nfundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased\noutputs generated by the AI system.\n\n(51)Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are\nresilient against attempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or\ncompromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the\nsystem\u2019s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI\nspecific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or trained\nmodels (e.g. adversarial attacks), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI\nsystem\u2019s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a\nlevel of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures should\ntherefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into\naccount as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\n\n(52)As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the\nplacing on the market, putting into service and use of high-risk AI systems\nshould be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council 51 setting out the requirements for\naccreditation and the market surveillance of products, Decision No 768/2008/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council 52 on a common framework for the\nmarketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council 53 on market surveillance and compliance of products (\u2018New\nLegislative Framework for the marketing of products\u2019).\n\n(53)It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the\nprovider, takes the responsibility for the placing on the market or putting\ninto service of a high-risk AI system, regardless of whether that natural or\nlegal person is the person who designed or developed the system.\n\n(54)The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure\nthe accomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up\nthe relevant documentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring\nsystem.

Therefore, prior to\nmaking their AI systems available in the Union, where an importer cannot be\nidentified, providers established outside the Union shall, by written mandate,\nappoint an authorised representative established in the Union.\n\n(57)In line with New Legislative Framework principles, specific obligations\nfor relevant economic operators, such as importers and distributors, should be\nset to ensure legal certainty and facilitate regulatory compliance by those\nrelevant operators.\n\n(58)Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental\nrights possibly associated with their use, including as regard the need to\nensure proper monitoring of the performance of an AI system in a real-life\nsetting, it is appropriate to set specific responsibilities for users. Users\nshould in particular use high-risk AI systems in accordance with the\ninstructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with\nregard to monitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to\nrecord-keeping, as appropriate.\n\n(59)It is appropriate to envisage that the user of the AI system should be the\nnatural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body under whose\nauthority the AI system is operated except where the use is made in the course\nof a personal non-professional activity.\n\n(60)In the light of the complexity of the artificial intelligence value chain,\nrelevant third parties, notably the ones involved in the sale and the supply\nof software, software tools and components, pre-trained models and data, or\nproviders of network services, should cooperate, as appropriate, with\nproviders and users to enable their compliance with the obligations under this\nRegulation and with competent authorities established under this Regulation.\n\n(61)Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to\nproviders to ensure compliance with this Regulation. Compliance with\nharmonised standards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council 54 should be a means for providers to\ndemonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. However, the\nCommission could adopt common technical specifications in areas where no\nharmonised standards exist or where they are insufficient.\n\n(62)In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI\nsystems, those systems should be subject to a conformity assessment prior to\ntheir placing on the market or putting into service.\n\n(63)It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and\navoid any possible duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products\nwhich are covered by existing Union harmonisation legislation following the\nNew Legislative Framework approach, the compliance of those AI systems with\nthe requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of the\nconformity assessment already foreseen under that legislation.

While safety risks of AI systems ensuring safety\nfunctions in machinery are addressed by the requirements of this Regulation,\ncertain specific requirements in the [Machinery Regulation] will ensure the\nsafe integration of the AI system into the overall machinery, so as not to\ncompromise the safety of the machinery as a whole. The [Machinery Regulation]\napplies the same definition of AI system as this Regulation.\n\n(64)Given the more extensive experience of professional pre-market certifiers\nin the field of product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it\nis appropriate to limit, at least in an initial phase of application of this\nRegulation, the scope of application of third-party conformity assessment for\nhigh-risk AI systems other than those related to products. Therefore, the\nconformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general rule\nby the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI\nsystems intended to be used for the remote biometric identification of\npersons, for which the involvement of a notified body in the conformity\nassessment should be foreseen, to the extent they are not prohibited.\n\n(65)In order to carry out third-party conformity assessment for AI systems\nintended to be used for the remote biometric identification of persons,\nnotified bodies should be designated under this Regulation by the national\ncompetent authorities, provided they are compliant with a set of requirements,\nnotably on independence, competence and absence of conflicts of interests.\n\n(66)In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification\nfor products regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate\nthat an AI system undergoes a new conformity assessment whenever a change\noccurs which may affect the compliance of the system with this Regulation or\nwhen the intended purpose of the system changes. In addition, as regards AI\nsystems which continue to \u2018learn\u2019 after being placed on the market or put into\nservice (i.e. they automatically adapt how functions are carried out), it is\nnecessary to provide rules establishing that changes to the algorithm and its\nperformance that have been pre-determined by the provider and assessed at the\nmoment of the conformity assessment should not constitute a substantial\nmodification.\n\n(67)High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their\nconformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the\ninternal market. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles to the\nplacing on the market or putting into service of high-risk AI systems that\ncomply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE\nmarking.\n\n(68)Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies\nmay be crucial for health and safety of persons and for society as a whole.

In certain\ncircumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be subject to\nspecific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and\nobligations for high-risk AI systems. In particular, natural persons should be\nnotified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious\nfrom the circumstances and the context of use. Moreover, natural persons\nshould be notified when they are exposed to an emotion recognition system or a\nbiometric categorisation system. Such information and notifications should be\nprovided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. Further, users,\nwho use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content\nthat appreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would\nfalsely appear to a person to be authentic, should disclose that the content\nhas been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial\nintelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin.\n\n(71)Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies\nthat requires novel forms of regulatory oversight and a safe space for\nexperimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of\nappropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal\nframework that is innovation-friendly, future-proof and resilient to\ndisruption, national competent authorities from one or more Member States\nshould be encouraged to establish artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes\nto facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under\nstrict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or\notherwise put into service.\n\n(72)The objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI\ninnovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing\nenvironment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring\ncompliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other\nrelevant Union and Member States legislation; to enhance legal certainty for\ninnovators and the competent authorities\u2019 oversight and understanding of the\nopportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, and to accelerate\naccess to markets, including by removing barriers for small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. To ensure uniform implementation across the\nUnion and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for\nthe regulatory sandboxes\u2019 implementation and a framework for cooperation\nbetween the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes.\nThis Regulation should provide the legal basis for the use of personal data\ncollected for other purposes for developing certain AI systems in the public\ninterest within the AI regulatory sandbox, in line with Article 6(4) of\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and\nwithout prejudice to Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/680.

Translation costs related to mandatory\ndocumentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant\ncost for providers and other operators, notably those of a smaller scale.\nMember States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and\naccepted by them for relevant providers\u2019 documentation and for communication\nwith operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible\nnumber of cross-border users.\n\n(74)In order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of\nknowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of\nproviders and notified bodies with their obligations under this Regulation,\nthe AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the\nTesting and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the\nMember States at national or EU level should possibly contribute to the\nimplementation of this Regulation. Within their respective mission and fields\nof competence, they may provide in particular technical and scientific support\nto providers and notified bodies.\n\n(75)It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible,\naccess to Testing and Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or\nlaboratories established or accredited pursuant to any relevant Union\nharmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the context of conformity\nassessment of products or devices covered by that Union harmonisation\nlegislation. This is notably the case for expert panels, expert laboratories\nand reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to\nRegulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746.\n\n(76)In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation\nof this Regulation a European Artificial Intelligence Board should be\nestablished. The Board should be responsible for a number of advisory tasks,\nincluding issuing opinions, recommendations, advice or guidance on matters\nrelated to the implementation of this Regulation, including on technical\nspecifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in\nthis Regulation and providing advice to and assisting the Commission on\nspecific questions related to artificial intelligence.\n\n(77)Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this\nRegulation. In this respect, each Member State should designate one or more\nnational competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the application\nand implementation of this Regulation. In order to increase organisation\nefficiency on the side of Member States and to set an official point of\ncontact vis-\u00e0-vis the public and other counterparts at Member State and Union\nlevels, in each Member State one national authority should be designated as\nnational supervisory authority.\n\n(78)In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into\naccount the experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their\nsystems and the design and development process or can take any possible\ncorrective action in a timely manner, all providers should have a post-market\nmonitoring system in place. This system is also key to ensure that the\npossible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to \u2018learn\u2019 after being\nplaced on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely\naddressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system\nin place to report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents or any\nbreaches to national and Union law protecting fundamental rights resulting\nfrom the use of their AI systems.\n\n(79)In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the\nrequirements and obligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union\nharmonisation legislation, the system of market surveillance and compliance of\nproducts established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply in its\nentirety. Where necessary for their mandate, national public authorities or\nbodies, which supervise the application of Union law protecting fundamental\nrights, including equality bodies, should also have access to any\ndocumentation created under this Regulation.\n\n(80)Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and\nrisk management rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated\nfinancial institutions in the course of provision of those services, including\nwhen they make use of AI systems.",

In order to ensure coherent application and\nenforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and\nrequirements of the Union financial services legislation, the authorities\nresponsible for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services\nlegislation, including where applicable the European Central Bank, should be\ndesignated as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the\nimplementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance\nactivities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised\nfinancial institutions. To further enhance the consistency between this\nRegulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under\nDirective 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 56 , it is\nalso appropriate to integrate the conformity assessment procedure and some of\nthe providers\u2019 procedural obligations in relation to risk management, post\nmarketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and\nprocedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited\nderogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management\nsystem of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on users of high-risk\nAI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by\nDirective 2013/36/EU.\n\n(81)The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in\naccordance with the requirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger\nuptake of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Union. Providers of non-\nhigh-risk AI systems should be encouraged to create codes of conduct intended\nto foster the voluntary application of the mandatory requirements applicable\nto high-risk AI systems. Providers should also be encouraged to apply on a\nvoluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to environmental\nsustainability, accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders\u2019\nparticipation in the design and development of AI systems, and diversity of\nthe development teams. The Commission may develop initiatives, including of a\nsectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical barriers hindering\ncross-border exchange of data for AI development, including on data access\ninfrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of\ndata.\n\n(82)It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk\nin accordance with this Regulation and thus are not required to comply with\nthe requirements set out herein are nevertheless safe when placed on the\nmarket or put into service. To contribute to this objective, the Directive\n2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 57 would apply as a\nsafety net.\n\n(83)In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent\nauthorities on Union and national level, all parties involved in the\napplication of this Regulation should respect the confidentiality of\ninformation and data obtained in carrying out their tasks.\n\n(84)Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the\nprovisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement.

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the\npreparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive\nall documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts\nsystematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing\nwith the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(86)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this\nRegulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

However, elements of the governance structure should be in place\nbefore then. In particular, Member States shall have appointed existing\nauthorities and/or established new authorities performing the tasks set out in\nthe legislation earlier, and the EU AI Board should be set-up and effective.\nBy the time of applicability, the European database of AI systems should be\nfully operative. In parallel to the adoption process, it is therefore\nnecessary to develop the database, so that its development has come to an end\nwhen the regulation enters into force.\n\n1.5.2.Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors,\ne.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or\ncomplementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union\ninvolvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is\nadditional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member\nStates alone.\n\nAn emerging patchy framework of potentially divergent national rules will\nhamper the seamless provision of AI systems across the EU and is ineffective\nin ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values\nacross the different Member States. A common EU legislative action on AI could\nboost the internal market and has great potential to provide European industry\nwith a competitive edge at the global scene and economies of scale that cannot\nbe achieved by individual Member States alone.\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\nThe E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the\nfunctioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and\nsets a basic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member\nStates, covering in principle all requirements applicable to digital services.\nThe evaluation of the Directive pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of\nthis cooperation mechanism, including important procedural aspects such as the\nlack of clear timeframes for response from Member States coupled with a\ngeneral lack of responsiveness to requests from their counterparts. This has\nled over the years to a lack of trust between Member States in addressing\nconcerns about providers offering digital services cross-border. The\nevaluation of the Directive showed the need to define a differentiated set of\nrules and requirements at European level. For this reason, the implementation\nof the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation would require a\nspecific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a governance structure\nensuring coordination of specific responsible bodies at EU level.\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible\nsynergies with other appropriate instruments\n\nThe Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence and\nAmending Certain Union Legislative Acts defines a new common framework of\nrequirements applicable to AI systems, which goes well beyond the framework\nprovided by existing legislation. For this reason, a new national and European\nregulatory and coordination function needs to be established with this\nproposal.\n\nAs regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments, the role of\nnotifying authorities at national level can be performed by national\nauthorities fulfilling similar functions sunder other EU regulations.",

These new rules require\na consistency mechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations\nunder this Regulation in the form of a new advisory group coordinating the\nactivities of national authorities.\n\nIn order to face these new tasks, it is necessary to appropriately resource\nthe Commission\u2019s services. The enforcement of the new Regulation is estimated\nto require 10 FTE \u00e0 regime (5 FTE for the support to the activities of the\nBoard and 5 FTE for the European Data Protection Supervisor acting as a\nnotifying body for AI systems deployed by a body of the European Union).\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control\nsystem(s) set up to mitigate them\n\nIn order to ensure that the members of the Board have the possibility to make\ninformed analysis on the basis of factual evidence, it is foreseen that the\nBoard should be supported by the administrative structure of the Commission\nand that an expert group be created to provide additional expertise where\nrequired.",
